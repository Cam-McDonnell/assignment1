Hi my name is Cameron. I like to ride my bike, play soccer, rock climb, and play video games. 

Programming Background:
Some of my favorite early projects in programming were making web sites in my web design class. Also some of the progects that required sorting arrays were very interesting. 
Some other fun projects were making a connect-four game and creating a poker game.

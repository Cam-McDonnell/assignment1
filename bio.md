Hi my name is Cameron. I like to ride my bike, play soccer, rock climb, and play video games. I have recently switch majors from ECE to CS and am excited to get back into more programming. I have done a bit of web design in the past but not in a long time so i am looking forward to learning more about it.

Programming Background:
Some of my favorite early projects in programming were making web sites in my web design class. Also some of the progects that required sorting arrays were very interesting. 
Some other fun projects were making a connect-four game and creating a poker game. I havent done any serious coding in about a year so i am a bit rusty but ready to pick it up again.
